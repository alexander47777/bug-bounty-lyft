# Launch Confidant in AWS using SaltStack orchestration

This Salt orchestraton code can be used to launch a Confidant infrastructure
with an ELB, a Confidant ASG, a DynamoDB table with indexes and KMS
keys for auth and at-rest encryption.

The ASG will launch with cloud-init injected environment and installation
commands, so it's meant mostly as a getting-started configuration, rather than
what you'll eventually want to run yourself. With this configuration, updating
environment variables will require re-running the orchestration and
terminate-rolling your Confidant ASG nodes.

## Work in progress

This example won't currently bring up a fully working Confidant install, but
should launch the majority of the infrastructure you need. We're continuing to
improve on this and will remove this section when the orchestration code can
launch a fully operational example in a single run.

## Warning

This orchestration code will launch infrastructure in AWS and will incur
charges. It will use a predefined format for the naming of AWS resources:

```
service_name-service_instance-region
```

service\_name, service\_instance and region are user-specified through
environment variables. So, for instance, if you pass in:

```bash
SERVICE_NAME=confidant SERVICE_INSTANCE=production REGION=useast1
```

your resources will be named as follows:

* ELB: confidant-production-useast1
* DynamoDB table: confidant-production-useast1
* Elasticache: confidant-production-useast1
* KMS at-rest key: confidant-production-useast1
* KMS auth key: authnz-production-useast1

If you specify a DNS domain, this code will also add a route53 CNAME entry for
the ELB. For instance, if you provide example.com:

* Route53: confidant-production-useast1.example.com

## Using the orchestration code

First, you should add a _pillar/local.sls_ file, to define your environment.
See the _pillar/example.sls_ file for an example configuration with all the
options.

Next, you'll need to create a python virtualenv with the python dependencies:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the orchestration:

```
env SERVICE_NAME=confidant SERVICE_INSTANCE=production REGION=useast1 salt-call -c .orchestration -m ./modules state.highstate
```
